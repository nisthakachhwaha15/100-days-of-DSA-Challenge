"""Delete an Element from an Array

Problem: Write a C program to delete the element at a given 1-based position pos from an array of n integers. Shift remaining elements to the left.

Input:
- First line: integer n
- Second line: n space-separated integers
- Third line: integer pos (1-based position to delete)

Output:
- Print the updated array with (n-1) elements, space-separated

Example:
Input:
5
10 20 30 40 50
2

Output:
10 30 40 50

Explanation: Delete position 2 (element 20), remaining elements shift left"""

n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
pos = int(input())

if 1 <= pos <= n:
    for i in range(pos - 1, n - 1):
        arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
    arr.pop()

for x in arr:
    print(x, end=" ")
